# ShoesOnContainers
E-commerce web application based on microservices.

I will create an e-commerce web application with Asp.Net Core, MongoDb, RabbitMq. 
I will try to do implement the following:
- Payments will be handled by Stripe. 
- There will be an Identity Server as a Token service. 
- I will dockerize the app and publish on Azure VM with Nginx. 
- I will try to build a CI-CD pipeline with Jenkins and GitHub hooks. 
- I will keep the docker images at Docker Hub. 
- Service discovery will be done with Consul. 
- I will try to orchestrate the containers with Kubernetes.
